I was unable to implement the arrow function for the lightbox feature, as I did not plan my time well (I said I wouldn't hack when I attended HackNY, but ended up hacking because everyone demoed and I honestly couldn't stay away--that was all my fault this past weekend, but I thought I owed it to myself after a midterm.)

Anyways, I used the Flickr API's search method to display an 8x3 grid of pictures about the SF Giants. Upon clicking one of the pictures, it gets larger against a purple backdrop (lightbox). I wasn't 100% sure about lightbox, but remembered one of my managers at PubNub this summer showing me it, and I read up on it again, so I'm feeling alright about it! That was definitely the hardest part. Accessing photos from the Flickr API also took time, and I had to read the docs a lot. 

I actually did not commit much in the beginning because I did most of the work in one sitting--I started right after a midterm and then didn't work at HackNY, as mentioned above, doing most of grunt work on Monday (again, usually I budget my time better.) 

I could host this on my personal site to give you a better URL, but the working lightbox can be viewed if you drag the index.html file into your web browser. It’s pretty slow in Safari, but not (as in, it’s fast to load) in Chrome. Hope this is alright for the URL—if not, I can get it on my website.
